# 🐑 RecapBot
I got tired of my friend being chronically Offline. This won't fix it but it's a start. 
RecapBot is a small Discord bot that makes quick summaries of what's been happening in your server.  
If you’ve been away for a bit, just type /recap [hours] and it’ll show you the main topics, who’s been actively messaging, most used reactions/most reacted to message, shared links, and a preview image if anyone has sent an image.

---

## ✨ Specifics
- Gives you a quick summary of recent messages.  
- Lists the most active users and common topics.  
- Counts reactions and shows the top ones. 
- Finds links, files, and image attachments (With a Preview).  
- Shows the most reacted message in the channel.

## 🧩 BEFORE Getting Started
You can make your own little custom discord bot/app in https://discord.com/developers. You should customize it and make it your own for the full experience. Setting up this part beforehand is very VERY important as it is needed to get TWO of the IDs and will also make me very happy.

## 🧩 Getting started
I will be adding the commands jut in case someone needs them or isn't familiar with something.

## 1. Fork or clone this repo as you will need to edit 1 file inside it.
Also, if you improve it in some way I'd love to take a look at it.

## 2. PLEASE install what it needs
```bash
## (Download Node.js)
## Then in the vscode terminal (I love you VSCode)
npm install
```

## 3. Add you Discord server ID and stuff and write it down in the .env file
 - In the project folder, create a file or rename the .env.example file into .env and edit the info inside!!
```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=[You get this id from the https://discord.com/developers site.]
APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER=[found in discord app dev thingy]
SERVER_IDENTIFIER=[with dev mode on, right click your server and click "copy id"]
```
🔒 Don’t share the .env file!! 🔒
It holds your bot token! It's already listed in .gitignore, so it won’t be uploaded to GitHub if you happen to remake this in a much more professional way. Anyway I recommend not touching it.

## 4. Run it
```bash
## Commands in case you need them:
npm run deploy
nom run dev
```
and when you see
```bash
## RecapBot is online as RecapBot#(idnumber)
```
ITS READY!!!

### ✨ Instruccions on Discord ✨ 
After giving the bot the necessarry permissions and inviting it to your server, type:
```bash
/recap [Hours] (delete the brackets)
```
And RecapBot will check the specified amount of hours of messages and send a "summary" embed that includes:
- How many messages were sent
- Who’s been the most active
- Which topics came up most
- What reactions were used
- The message with the most reactions
- Any links, files, or image previews it finds

## 🧵 Example

✨ summary
• messages: 58
• people: 12

🛠 Built with
- Node.js
- Discord.js
- TypeScript
- dotenv

### ☁️ Keeping it online!!!!
If you want the bot to stay online all the time, you can host it on a service like Render, Railway, or any VPS that supports Node.js.
I tested it and it should work as fully intended so it’ll stay active as long as you keep your terminal open.
This project was just made for fun and im not planning on hosting it elsewhere for the moment but that could change so...
